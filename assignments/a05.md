# Assignment 5

1. Create a list of 10 000 random numbers in the range 0-100. Use the following code:

```{python}
import numpy as np

l = list(np.random.randint(0, 100, 10000))
```

2. Calculate the arithmetic mean of numbers in the list. Don't use pre-made functions! Write the code 'from scratch', using a `for` loop.

3. Calculate the standard deviation of the numbers in the list. Don't use pre-made functions! Write the code 'from scratch', using a `for` loop. Don't know how to compute the standard deviation? Look here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation>.

4. Generate a new list with numbers from a different range. Observe how the mean and standard deviation change depending on the range.
