# Assignment 6

1. Create a `dict` with a dictionary that translates English words to your native language (if your native language is English, translate to a different language of your choice). Place at least 8 English words as keys and their translations as values. Use the `dict(zip())` functions to create the `dict`.
2. Write a code cell that defines a sentence in English and returns the sentence with known words translated into your native language. If the word is not in the dictionary, leave it in English. Some functions that might be useful are `string.split()` and `string.lower()`
