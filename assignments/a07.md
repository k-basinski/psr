# Assignment 7

1. Generate a list of at least 100 random numbers. They can be generated randomly using code from _Assignment 5_.
2. Write a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the arithmetic mean of these numbers.
3. Write a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the standard deviation of these numbers. You can re-use code from _Assignment 5_.
4. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns their associated z-scores (standardized values). Don't know how to z-score? Look [here](https://www.statisticshowto.com/standardized-values-examples/).
5. Check if your z-scores are correct. Use your mean and standard deviation functions from 2. and 3. on the z-scored list. What mean and SD values do you expect to get?
6.  Write a function that translates words from English to your native language. You can re-use the `dict` from Assignment 6. The function should have a form:

```python
def translate_word(word, dictionary, return_original=False, ignore_case=True):
    """Finds word in a dictionary and returns translation.

    This function takes a word in one language and a dictionary containing 
    translations as arguments. It looks for a word in the dictionary and, if found
    returns the translation. If the word is not in the dictionary, the function returns
    None or, the original word if return_original=True. The ignore_case argument specifies
    if the search should be case-sensitive or not.

    Parameters
    ----------
    word : str
        A word to look up in the dictionary.
    dictionary: dict
        A dictionary containing words (keys) and their translations (values).
    return_original: bool
        If true, the function returns the original word if no translation is found.
    ignore_case: bool
        If true, the words and translations are both converted to lowercase and than compared.

    Returns
    -------
    str, None
        A translated word, an original word or None.

    """

```

7. Call the function with just two arguments.
8. Call the function with all arguments.
9. Call the function with `word`, `dictionary` and `ignore_case` arguments.
