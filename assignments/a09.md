# Assignment 9

1. Use _numpy_ to generate an array of shape (10,10). Use a random number generator integers from 1 to 10. Print the array.
2. Use array slicing to show the first five numbers in the second row (rows are axis=0)
3. Use array slicing to show the last two numbers in the last column (columns are axis=1)
4. Using _numpy's_ `mean()` and `std()` function, calculate means and standard deviations of each of the columns (You can do this with two lines of code without any loops). Are they means and SDs similar or different? Can you explain, why the values are what they are?
